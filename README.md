First step is to fork this repo into your own Github account - if you don't remember how, then refer back Lesson 0 contents.

Create a new webpage on a subject that you're interested in (maybe the same topic you used for your Codepen submission). The page should **NOT** use any framework like Bootstrap and it should include the following elements:
  - The `.html` page and a linked `.css` file applies a consistent color scheme to links and text on your page.
  - A page header with a title and description for the site.
  - An articles section with three articles, each including a title, summary and a link.
  - A page footer containing info about you or the site.
  - Proper use of the semantic HTML tags we discussed.
  - Research the `:first-child` pseudo-class and use it to style the first article so that it stands out from the others.
  - Use this website [Lorem Ipsum](http://www.lipsum.com/) to generate random blocks of contents to fill your website.
  - **Commit often (with good meaningful commit messages), and Push to Github regularly.**
  - Make your website look as close as possible as this layout (there are things we didn't cover yet, such as layout of the right and left side, but consider that an optional challenge if you want one)
  - *Please note that this is just a sketch - you can choose the colours, fonts and images that you want to use in the page.*
